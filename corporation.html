As an artificial being, a corporation has no physical body, consciousness, or biological life; it exists and persists only because the legal system recognizes and sustains it. Its agency is exercised indirectly through human agents—directors, officers, employees, and agents—who make decisions and perform acts in the corporation’s name. The corporation’s rights and duties are primarily legal and instrumental: it may own property, enter contracts, sue and be sued, and incur obligations, but these capacities are conferred and limited by statute and charter. Unlike human beings, who are concrete biological substances with direct causal powers, moral consciousness, and personal responsibility, a corporation’s personhood is institutional and dependent on social and legal practices; it can be held liable and regulated, yet its moral agency is mediated through the people who run it. Because corporate personhood is a legal fiction, courts may protect it to promote commerce and stability, but they may also disregard or pierce the corporate veil when the fiction is abused, fraudulent, or used to defeat public policy or creditors’ rights."">

The Revised Corporation Code (R.A. 11232) modernized corporate formation (including the One‑Person Corporation), governance, perpetual existence, and shareholder protections. The Securities Regulation Code (R.A. 8799) defines securities, investor protection policies, registration and disclosure requirements, and the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Foreign Investments Act (R.A. 7042, as amended) establishes the Foreign Investment Negative List, capitalization and registration requirements, and procedures for foreign enterprises doing business in the Philippines. Sectoral laws such as the General Banking Law (R.A. 8791), the Insurance Code, and other special statutes impose licensing, capital, governance, and supervisory regimes for regulated industries and vest oversight in agencies like the Bangko Sentral and the Insurance Commission. Constitutional provisions on the national economy and patrimony (Article XII) restrict land and certain industry ownership to Filipino citizens or corporations with required Filipino ownership percentages, shaping what corporations may lawfully own or do.">

Nonstock corporations do not issue shares and may not distribute net income as dividends to members; any surplus must be applied to the corporation’s stated purposes, may be retained as reserves or endowments, and reasonable compensation to officers and employees is permitted but private inurement is prohibited. Nonstock corporations that engage in commercial activities may incur tax on unrelated business income under the tax code.
