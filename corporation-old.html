As an artificial being, a corporation has no physical body, consciousness, or biological life; it exists and persists only because the legal system recognizes and sustains it. Its agency is exercised indirectly through human agents—directors, officers, employees, and agents—who make decisions and perform acts in the corporation’s name. The corporation’s rights and duties are primarily legal and instrumental: it may own property, enter contracts, sue and be sued, and incur obligations, but these capacities are conferred and limited by statute and charter. Unlike human beings, who are concrete biological substances with direct causal powers, moral consciousness, and personal responsibility, a corporation’s personhood is institutional and dependent on social and legal practices; it can be held liable and regulated, yet its moral agency is mediated through the people who run it. Because corporate personhood is a legal fiction, courts may protect it to promote commerce and stability, but they may also disregard or pierce the corporate veil when the fiction is abused, fraudulent, or used to defeat public policy or creditors’ rights.">

The Revised Corporation Code (R.A. 11232) modernized corporate formation (including the One‑Person Corporation), governance, perpetual existence, and shareholder protections. The Securities Regulation Code (R.A. 8799) defines securities, investor protection policies, registration and disclosure requirements, and the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Foreign Investments Act (R.A. 7042, as amended) establishes the Foreign Investment Negative List, capitalization and registration requirements, and procedures for foreign enterprises doing business in the Philippines. Sectoral laws such as the General Banking Law (R.A. 8791), the Insurance Code, and other special statutes impose licensing, capital, governance, and supervisory regimes for regulated industries and vest oversight in agencies like the Bangko Sentral and the Insurance Commission. Constitutional provisions on the national economy and patrimony (Article XII) restrict land and certain industry ownership to Filipino citizens or corporations with required Filipino ownership percentages, shaping what corporations may lawfully own or do.">

             data-text="Another essential way to classify corporations is by examining the number of incorporators who originally formed the entity. The first classification is the Corporation Sole, which is quite unique in its structure. It is formed by a single religious leader, such as a bishop or head of a denomination. Its primary purpose is to administer and manage the affairs, property, and temporalities of that specific religious group as a trustee. A more recent and highly popular classification under the Revised Corporation Code is the One Person Corporation, or OPC. The OPC allows a single stockholder, who can be a natural person, trust, or estate, to form a corporation without needing partners. This grants the sole owner the shield of limited liability, previously only available to groups of investors. Finally, we have the Ordinary Corporation, which is the most common business structure. This traditional form is created by multiple incorporators working together to pool their resources. Typically, the law requires anywhere from two to fifteen incorporators to establish this kind of entity, depending on specific jurisdictional rules.">

             data-text="Beyond standard business structures, the law recognizes Special Corporations designed to serve specific societal needs. These entities are governed by special provisions because of the vital public interests they handle. A prominent example is the Educational Corporation, which is explicitly organized for educational and learning purposes. These corporations govern the operations of schools, colleges, and universities within the country. They are subject to the oversight of educational agencies and must maintain strict standards to fulfill their academic missions. Similarly, the law provides for Religious Corporations, which are formed to govern religious groups, societies, or sects. These can be further divided into corporations sole, which we discussed earlier, or religious societies formed by a group of believers. Their primary function is not to generate profit for investors, but to ensure the organized practice and administration of their faith. By giving these institutions corporate status, the law allows them to own property, enter into contracts, and protect their members. Together, these special corporations play a crucial role in shaping the educational and spiritual landscape of the nation.">

The first category is the Domestic Corporation, which is straightforward to identify. A domestic corporation is one that is formally incorporated and organized under the laws of the host country, such as the Philippines. Because it owes its legal existence to the local government, it is subject to the full regulatory power and protection of that state. In contrast, a Foreign Corporation is formed, organized, or existing under any laws other than those of the local jurisdiction. Despite being created abroad, these entities often seek to expand their operations and participate in the local economy. To legally conduct business within the host country, a foreign corporation must first obtain a specific license from the Securities and Exchange Commission. This licensing process ensures that the foreign entity agrees to be bound by local laws and can be sued in local courts. Furthermore, the laws of its home country must reciprocally allow local citizens to do business there. Understanding this distinction is vital for determining compliance with foreign ownership restrictions in certain nationalized industries.">

When categorized by purpose, we distinguish between Public and Private corporations. Public corporations are entities created by the state to govern a portion of the state itself, such as cities, municipalities, or provinces. Private corporations, on the other hand, are formed by individuals for a private aim, whether that is generating profit or supporting a charitable cause. Looking at legal status, a corporation is considered 'De Jure' when it has strictly and completely complied with all legal requirements for its creation. A De Jure corporation has a flawless legal existence that cannot be directly attacked by anyone, not even the state. Conversely, a 'De Facto' corporation is one that exists in reality, but has a specific defect or flaw in its incorporation process. For a De Facto corporation to exist, there must have been a valid law under which it could be formed and a genuine, good faith attempt to organize under that law. Despite the defect, it acts as a corporation and conducts business in the real world. The law temporarily recognizes its corporate acts to protect innocent third parties who deal with it, although the state can legally challenge its existence later.">

A share of stock represents the interest or right that a stockholder has in the management, surplus profits, and upon dissolution, the assets of the corporation. It is a unit of ownership that grants the holder a specific bundle of legal rights. First and foremost among these rights is the right to participate in the management of the corporation, usually exercised through voting. Second, shareholders have the right to receive dividends when declared by the Board of Directors out of unrestricted retained earnings. Third, they possess the pre-emptive right to subscribe to all issues or disposition of shares of any class, protecting them from ownership dilution. Fourth, they have the right to inspect corporate books and records at reasonable hours on business days. Finally, they hold the right to a proportionate share of the remaining corporate assets upon liquidation. Understanding these fundamental rights is essential for any investor or corporate officer. Together, these rights ensure that the ultimate control and economic benefit of the enterprise remain securely with its owners.">

Common shares represent the residual ownership of the corporation, meaning these shareholders bear the ultimate risk of loss and reap the ultimate reward of success. Unlike other classes of shares, common stock is not entitled to any fixed or guaranteed dividend. Instead, common shareholders receive dividends only after all obligations to preferred shareholders have been fully satisfied. Because they carry the greatest financial risk, the law guarantees that common shares always inherently possess complete voting rights. They are the primary voice in electing the Board of Directors and directing the long-term vision of the company. Furthermore, a corporation cannot issue common shares without voting rights, ensuring that those who bear the residual risk maintain control. In the event of corporate liquidation, common shareholders are the very last to receive any distribution from the remaining assets. Despite this subordinate position in liquidation, the potential for capital appreciation and unlimited dividend growth makes common shares a highly attractive investment.

Preferred shares are a special class of stock that grants its holders certain privileges or preferences not enjoyed by common shareholders. The most typical preference is the right to receive dividends before any distributions are made to the common stockholders. Additionally, preferred shares usually carry a preference in the distribution of corporate assets in the unfortunate event of liquidation. However, these financial advantages come with a significant trade-off regarding corporate control. Under the Revised Corporation Code, preferred shares are generally issued as non-voting shares, meaning holders cannot vote for the Board of Directors. Despite being classified as non-voting, the law expressly reserves their right to vote on crucial, fundamental corporate matters, such as amending the articles of incorporation or dissolving the company. It is also important to note that preferred shares can only be issued with a stated par value. By offering a safer, more predictable return, preferred shares effectively bridge the gap between pure equity and debt financing. They provide corporations with flexible capital structuring options while protecting the day-to-day voting control of common shareholders.">

Redeemable shares are a unique class of stock that the corporation expressly reserves the right to buy back or redeem at a specified date or upon a certain event. What makes redeemable shares particularly powerful is that they can be purchased by the corporation regardless of whether there are unrestricted retained earnings, provided the redemption does not cause corporate insolvency. Treasury shares, on the other hand, are ordinary shares that have been previously issued, fully paid for, and subsequently reacquired by the corporation through purchase, donation, or other lawful means. Unlike unissued shares, treasury shares do not possess voting rights and do not receive dividends while held in the corporate treasury. However, the corporation can resell treasury shares at any reasonable price fixed by the Board of Directors. It is critical to note that a corporation can only purchase its own shares to become treasury shares if it has sufficient unrestricted retained earnings to cover the cost. This rule strictly protects the corporation's creditors by ensuring capital is not unlawfully returned to shareholders.

The primary purpose of founders' shares is to reward the individuals who took the initial risk to establish the business enterprise. To provide this reward, the law allows founders' shares to be granted certain exclusive rights and privileges not available to other classes of stock. The most significant and common privilege is the exclusive right to vote for and be voted as directors of the corporation. However, to prevent the perpetual monopolization of corporate control, the Securities and Exchange Commission strictly limits this exclusive voting right. Under the Revised Corporation Code, this exclusive privilege cannot exceed a period of five years from the date of incorporation. Once this five-year period expires, the exclusive voting rights are automatically terminated, and the founders' shares typically revert to the status of ordinary voting shares. Any other financial preferences granted to founders' shares must not violate the anti-fraud provisions of corporate law. This balanced approach allows founders to steer the company securely through its crucial early years while ensuring long-term democratic control for all investors.">

These shares are designed to reward the original organizers and promoters who took the initial risk to establish the business. To do this, the law allows them to be granted exclusive privileges, most notably the exclusive right to vote for and be voted as directors. However, to ensure corporate democracy in the long run, the SEC strictly limits this power. Under the Revised Corporation Code, what is the strict limitation placed on this exclusive privilege? Is it A, it expires exactly ten years from the first board meeting? Is it B, it cannot exceed a period of five years from the date of incorporation? Is it C, it is perpetually valid as long as the founder holds one share? Or is it D, it expires immediately upon the first cash dividend declaration? Lock in your final answer.">

             data-text="In the Philippine accounting setting, corporations generally utilize one of two accepted methods to record transactions relating to their capital stock. These two approaches are known as the Memorandum Method and the Journal Entry Method. Both methods are designed to track the authorization, subscription, and eventual payment of corporate shares. Ultimately, regardless of which method a corporation chooses to adopt, both will yield the exact same total stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. The primary difference between the two lies purely in how they monitor the authorized and unissued shares within the general ledger system. It is also important to clarify the terminology used in these equity transactions. For instance, the term 'Paid-Up Capital' is not actually a specific account title used in formal journal entries. Instead, Paid-Up Capital simply represents the actual cash or property that has been received from the shareholders. In the financial statements, this paid-up portion is formally represented by the sum of the Share Capital and any Additional Paid-in Capital accounts. In the succeeding slides, we will compare these two methods side-by-side using practical proforma entries.">

            <p>Corporations use two primary methods to record authorized, subscribed, and issued capital stock.</p>

                <li><strong>The Memorandum Method:</strong> The most widely used approach in practice; relies on descriptive memos for authorization.</li>

                <li><strong>Shared Outcome:</strong> Both methods ultimately yield the exact same Total Stockholders' Equity presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarification:</strong> "Paid-Up Capital" is not a formal account title, but rather the sum of Share Capital and Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC).</li>

             data-text="The first major event in corporate accounting is the official authorization to issue shares of stock. This authorization is granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission upon the approval of the Articles of Incorporation. Under the Memorandum Method, this event is not recorded using formal debits and credits. Instead, the accountant simply writes a descriptive memorandum entry directly into the general journal. This memo details the total number of authorized shares and their designated par value. Conversely, the Journal Entry Method requires formal accounting recognition of this authorization. Under this second method, the accountant debits a specific account called Unissued Capital Stock for the total authorized amount. Simultaneously, a corresponding credit is made to the Authorized Capital Stock account for the exact same value. This establishes a formal ledger baseline representing the maximum legal limit of shares the corporation can distribute. Throughout the life of the corporation, this Authorized Capital Stock account balance will remain unchanged unless formally amended through the SEC.">

When an investor signs a subscription contract, a legally binding receivable is created in favor of the corporation. Interestingly, recording the initial subscription is completely identical under both the Memorandum and Journal Entry methods. The accountant will debit the Subscriptions Receivable account to represent the amount owed by the investors. Simultaneously, a credit is made to the Subscribed Capital Stock account. This Subscribed Capital Stock account represents shares that are reserved for the investor but have not yet been fully paid or issued. It is strictly recorded at the par value of the shares subscribed. If the investors agreed to buy the shares at a price higher than the par value, a premium is generated. This excess amount is immediately credited to the Additional Paid-in Capital or Share Premium account at the exact moment of subscription. Recognizing the premium during the subscription phase is crucial because the economic benefit is already contractually secured.">

Let us first examine a scenario where shares are subscribed and paid exactly at their stated par value, meaning no additional paid-in capital is involved. When cash is collected, both methods simply debit the Cash account and credit the Subscriptions Receivable account. Once the subscription is fully paid, the corporation is legally obligated to issue the formal stock certificates. It is at this moment of issuance that the two accounting methods diverge once again. Under the Memorandum Method, the accountant debits Subscribed Capital Stock to remove the temporary reservation. The corresponding credit is then made directly to the primary Capital Stock or Share Capital account. However, under the Journal Entry Method, the entry looks slightly different. While the debit remains to Subscribed Capital Stock, the credit is made to the Unissued Capital Stock account instead. This credit reduces the pool of unissued shares, reflecting that they have now been officially transferred to the shareholders.">

As we established earlier, the premium is fully recognized and credited during the initial subscription entry. Therefore, when the actual cash payments are collected from the investors, the entry is straightforward. The accountant merely debits Cash and credits Subscriptions Receivable for the total collection, which includes the premium portion. No adjustments are made to the Additional Paid-in Capital account during the payment collection process. When the final payment is received and the shares are issued, the entries to convert the stock are identical to the par value scenario. For the Memorandum Method, Subscribed Capital Stock is debited and the Capital Stock account is credited at par value. For the Journal Entry Method, Subscribed Capital Stock is debited and Unissued Capital Stock is credited, also at par value. The Share Premium remains untouched because it was already correctly positioned in the equity section during step two. This ensures that the par value of the issued stock and the excess premium are kept strictly separated in the financial records.">

             data-text="As we conclude this topic, let us review the most critical takeaways regarding these corporate accounting methods. First, remember that Additional Paid-in Capital must be recognized at the time of subscription, not upon the final issuance of the stock certificate. This matching principle ensures that the premium is recorded as soon as the corporation secures the contractual right to receive it. Second, the Memorandum Method is generally the preferred and most widely used approach in actual accounting practice. Its simplicity reduces the number of general ledger accounts needed, making the bookkeeping process more streamlined. Third, always keep in mind that the financial statement presentation remains identical regardless of the method chosen. Under the Memorandum Method, the total issued capital is read directly from the ending balance of the Capital Stock account. Under the Journal Entry Method, you must mathematically determine the issued capital. This is done by deducting the current balance of the Unissued Capital Stock account from the static Authorized Capital Stock account. Both calculations will ultimately guide you to the exact same total stockholders' equity, ensuring accurate and transparent financial reporting.">
